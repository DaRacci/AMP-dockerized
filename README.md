# Forked from [AMP-Dockerized](https://github.com/MitchTalmadge/AMP-dockerized)

# AMP-dockerized
This repository bundles [CubeCoders AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) into a Debian-based [Docker image.](https://hub.docker.com/r/racci/amp-dockerized)
(`racci/amp-dockerized:latest`) so that you can set up game servers with ease! 

In a nutshell, AMP (Application Management Panel) allows you to manage one or more game servers from a web UI. You need a [CubeCoders AMP Licence](https://cubecoders.com/AMP#buyAMP) to use this image.

Updates to AMP are automatically bundled into new Docker images. We check for updates every 15 minutes and package them up for you right away!

*Please note:* This is a community-made unofficial image, and is not endorsed by CubeCoders.

# Getting Help

There isn't any help for this fork as its main use is for myself.
